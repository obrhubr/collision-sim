# Collision Simulation

I wanted to simulate collisions between spheres to learn more about impulse and physical simulations. The simulation exports data to a `.csv` file and you can play it back in python. 
I did this because I didn't know how to show graphics in C++.

I used [The Lone Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPzyNOHY3A4)'s video to get the simulation up and running. 
The graphics part of the project was realised by a friend of mine who knows his way around TKinter way better than me.
